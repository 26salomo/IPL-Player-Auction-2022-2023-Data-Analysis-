# IPL-Player-Auction-2022-2023-Data-Analysis 🏏 

This repository contains an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** project on the **IPL Player Auction Dataset**, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kalilurrahman/ipl-player-auction-dataset-from-start-to-now).  
The aim of this project is to uncover **key insights, business implications, and patterns** in the IPL player auction market.

## 📊 Project Overview

The Indian Premier League (IPL) player auction is one of the most exciting events in cricket, where teams compete to secure top talent.  
This analysis explores trends in **player cost, type distribution, retention, and team spending strategies** to answer questions such as:

- Which type of players are most valued in the auction?  
- How do franchises allocate budgets across different player categories?  
- What are the retention patterns between seasons?  
- Which teams show efficient vs. aggressive spending strategies?

## 🔎 Key Insights

- **All-Rounders Lead Market Value** → The top 3 most expensive players in 2023 are all-rounders, confirming their high strategic value.  
- **High Cost Disparity** → While the average player cost is **0.64 CR ($82,500)**, Sam Curran’s contract reached **18.5 CR ($2.22M)**, reflecting extreme valuation gaps.  
- **Dominance of All-Rounders and Bowlers** → These categories hold the highest base price averages, but with large cost variations across teams.  
- **Squad Retention** → **322 players** were retained from 2022 to 2023, showing strong trust in existing squads.  
- **Team Strategies**:  
  - *RR*: Largest squad size → preference for depth.  
  - *SRH*: Highest spending two years in a row → with focus on bowlers but biggest spend on batsmen.  
  - *KKR*: Most cost-efficient → reducing avg. player cost from **0.40 CR to 0.245 CR** while still refreshing the squad.  
- **Unsold Players** → Mostly all-rounders and bowlers, possibly due to oversupply or selective team strategies.

## 📌 Business Implications

- **Multi-skilled players (all-rounders)** hold premium value, making them a critical focus for both scouting and player development.  
- **Huge cost disparities** suggest an opportunity for data-driven scouting to identify undervalued talent.  
- **Retention patterns** emphasize that long-term squad stability is as important as marquee signings.  
- **Unsold player analysis** may reveal overlooked opportunities or imbalances in team strategies.
